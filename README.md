# QuranFinder-App

Our graduation project is the work I’m most proud of so far. To graduate from Grade 12, we were required to create a final project. We actually started preparing for it in Grade 11 — brainstorming ideas and asking ourselves: what should we build?

A phishing protection system? Too basic.
A Talabat-style cafeteria app? Too saturated.

Then it clicked — not  anyone else.  me.

Every prayer/adhan app I had used felt incomplete. Something was always missing.

That’s when I realized: why don’t we build a prayer app that feels like a truly modern, high-quality application — designed with intention, simplicity, and purpose?

But I didn’t just want to redesign what already exists. I wanted to build something unique.

So I introduced a new feature: a customizable filter that allows users to clear out distractions 
and focus only on what matters to them. And more importantly, I created an advanced mosque search 
filter — where users can instantly find mosques that match exactly what they’re looking for, 
whether it’s specific programs, prayer times, or even memorization opportunities. With a single 
tap, users can discover the right environment to support their worship, learning, and spiritual growth.

It wasn’t just another prayer app. It became a tool for both daily worship and meaningful engagement — something I couldn’t find anywhere else.

We went on to be selected with five other groups out of almost 100 to be chosen to present our project during the TVET Week Event, where we presented to high ranking police officers, parents and most importantly the Chairman of ACTVET.

We used Expo to present our app, HTML and Javascript to code it.
